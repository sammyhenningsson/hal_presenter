# HALPresenter
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/hal_presenter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/hal_presenter)

HALPresenter is a DSL for creating serializers conforming to [JSON HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html). This DSL is highly influenced by ActiveModelSerializers.
Check out [this benchmark](https://gist.github.com/sammyhenningsson/890f7e4d6967883666851eb6aab92adb) for a comparison to other serializers.  
So, generating some json from an object, whats the big deal? Well if your API is not driven by hypermedia and your payloads most of the time just looks the same, then this might be overkill. But if you do have dynamic payloads (e.g the payload attributes and links depend on the context) then this gem greatly simplifies serialization and puts all the serialization logic in one place.
This documentation might be a bit long and dull, but skim through it and check out the examples. I think you'll get the hang of it.  

## Installation
```sh
gem install hal_presenter
```
With Gemfile:

```sh
gem 'hal_presenter'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

## Intro
Lets start with an example. Say you have your typical blog and you want to serialize post resources. Posts have some text, an author and possibly some comments. Only the author of the post may edit or delete it. A serializer could then be written as:
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model Post
  
  attribute :text
  attribute :characters do
    resource.text.size
  end
  
  link :self do
    "/posts/#{resource.id}"
  end
  
  link :author do
    "/users/#{resource.author.id}"
  end
  
  link :edit do
    "/posts/#{resource.id}/edit" if resource.author.id == options[:current_user]
  end
  
  link :delete do
    "/posts/#{resource.id}" if resource.author.id == options[:current_user]
  end
  
  embed :recent_comments
end

```
Instances of `Post` can now be serialized with `HALPresenter.to_hal(post, current_user: some_user)` which will produce the following (assuming the current user is the author of the post. Else the edit/delete links would not be present):

``` ruby
{
  "text": "some very important stuff",
  "characters": 25,
    "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/posts/5"
    },
    "author": {
      "href": "/users/8"
    },
    "edit": {
      "href": "/posts/5/edit"
    },
    "delete": {
      "href": "/posts/5"
    }
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "recent_comments": {
      "count": 2,
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "/posts/5/recent_comments"
        }
      },
      "_embedded": {
        "comments": [
          {
            "comment": "lorem ipsum",
            "_links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "/posts/5/comment/1"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "comment": "dolor sit",
            "_links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "/posts/5/comment/2"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
_Note_: In the output above, `recent_comments` is a collection and collections have their items embedded. Since this collection is
embedded in the post resource that's why we get two levels of embedded resources.


## Defining a Serializer
Serializers are defined by extending `HALPresenter` in the begining of the class declaration. This will add the following class methods:
- [`::model(clazz)`](#model)
- [`::attribute(name, value = nil, embed_depth: nil, &block)`](#attribute)
- [`::link(rel, value = nil, **options, &block)`](#link)
- [`::curie(rel, value = nil, embed_depth: nil, &block)`](#curie)
- [`::profile(value = nil, **kwargs, &block)`](#profile)
- [`::policy(clazz)`](#policy)
- [`::namespace(curie, &block)`](#namespace)
- [`::embed(name, value = nil, embed_depth: nil, presenter_class: nil, &block)`](#embed)
- [`::collection`](#collection)
- [`::to_hal(resource = nil, **options)`](#to_hal)
- [`::to_collection(resources = [], **options)`](#to_collection)
- [`::post_serialize(&block)`](#post_serialize)
- [`::from_hal(payload, resource = nil)`](#from_hal)

### ::model
The `model` class method is used to register the resource Class that this serializer handles. (There's no Rails magic that automagically maps models to serializers.)
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model Post
end
```
This make it possible to serialize `Post` instances with `HALPresenter.to_hal`. HALPresenter will then lookup the right presenter and delegate the serialization to it 
(which in the case above would be `PostSerializer`).
``` ruby
post = Post.new(*args)
HALPresenter.to_hal(post)
```
If a model does not have it's own presenter but one of its superclasses does, then that will be used.
``` ruby
class SubPost < Post; end
sub_post = SubPost.new(*args)
HALPresenter.to_hal(sub_post) # will lookup PostSerializer since there isn't a specific one for SubPost
```

Using the `model` class method is not required for serialization. The serializer can also be called directly.
``` ruby
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)
```
The serializer class may also be specified as an option, using the `:presenter` key.
``` ruby
HALPresenter.to_hal(post, {presenter: PostSerializer})
```
Even though the `model` class method is optional, it is very useful if the serializer should be selected dynamically and when the serializer is used for deserialization.


### ::attribute
The `attribute` class method specifies an attribute (property) to be serialized. The first argument, `name`, is required and specifies the name of the attribute. When `::attribute` is called with only one argument, the resources being serialized are expected to respond to that argument and the returned value is what ends up in the payload.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :title
end

post = OpenStruct.new(title: "hello")
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"title": "hello"}
```
If `::attribute` is called with two arguments, then the second arguments is what ends up in the payload.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :title, "world"
end

post = OpenStruct.new(title: "ignored")
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"title": "world"}
```
When a block is passed to `::attribute`, then the return value of that block is what ends up in the payload.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :title do
    resource.title.upcase
  end
end

post = OpenStruct.new(title: "hello")
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"title": "HELLO"}
```
Notice that the object being serialized (`post` in the above example) is accessible inside the block by the `resource` method.  
The keyword argument `:embed_depth` may be specified to set a max allowed nesting depth for the corresponding attribute to be serialized. See [`embed_depth`](#keyword-argument-embed_depth-passed-to-attribute-link-curie-and-embed).  

### ::link
The `link` class method specifies a link to be added to the _\_links_ property. The first argument, `rel`, is required. `::link` must be called with either a second argument (`value`) or a block.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  link :self, '/posts/1'
end

PostSerializer.to_hal   # => {"_links": {"self": {"href": "/posts/1"}}}
```
When a block is passed to `::link`, the block must evaluate to either `nil`, a String containing the href or a hash with symbol keys.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter

  link :self do
    "/posts/#{resource.id}"
  end
end

post = OpenStruct.new(id: 5)
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"_links": {"self": {"href": "/posts/5"}}}
```
When the block returns a hash the following keys will be used `:href`, `:type`, `:deprecation`, `:profile`, `:title` and `:templated`.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter

  link :other do
    {
      href: "/posts/#{resource.id}",
      title: resource.title,
      type: resource.type,
    }
  end
end

post = OpenStruct.new(id: 5, title: 'Foo', type: 'bar')
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {
                              #      "_links": {
                              #        "other": {
                              #          "href": "/posts/5",
                              #          "title": "Foo",
                              #          "type": "bar"
                              #        }
                              #      }
                              #    }
```

Multiple links can have the same relation. If so, they will be serialized as an array.
```ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter

  link :item, "/foo"

  link :item do
    "/bar"
  end
end

PostSerializer.to_hal   # =>
                        # {
                        #   "_links": {
                        #     "item": [
                        #       {
                        #         "href": "/foo"
                        #       },
                        #       {
                        #         "href": "/bar"
                        #       }
                        #     ]
                        #   }
                        # }
```

The following options may be given to `::link`:
- `embed_depth` - sets a max allowed nesting depth for the corresponding link to be serialized. See [`embed_depth`](#keyword-argument-embed_depth-passed-to-attribute-link-curie-and-embed).
- `curie` - prepends a curie to the rel.
- `title` - a string used for labelling the link (e.g. in a user interface).
- `type` - the media type of the resource returned after following this link.
- `deprecation` - a URL providing information about the deprecation of this link.
- `profile` - a URI that hints about the profile of the target resource.  

### ::curie
The `curie` class method specifies a curie to be added to the _curies_ list. The first argument, `rel`, is required. `::curie` must be called with either a second argument (`value`) or a block.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter

  curie :doc, '/api/docs/{rel}'
  link :'doc:user', '/users/5'
end

PostSerializer.to_hal   # => {"_links":{"doc:user":{"href":"/users/5"},"curies":[{"name":"doc","href":"/api/docs/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
```
When a block is passed to `::curie`, the return value of that block is what ends up as the href of the curie.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter

  curie :doc do
  '/api/docs/{rel}'
  end
  link :'doc:user', '/users/5'
end

post = OpenStruct.new(id: 5)
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"_links":{"doc:user":{"href":"/users/5"},"curies":[{"name":"doc","href":"/api/docs/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
```
The keyword argument `:embed_depth` may be specified to set a max allowed nesting depth for the corresponding curie to be serialized. See [`embed_depth`](#keyword-argument-embed_depth-passed-to-attribute-link-curie-and-embed).  
When a resource is embedded in another resource all curies are added to the root resource. This ensures that each curie only appear once in the output.
Note that curies may get renamed if there are conflicts between them. See example in [`::embed`](#embed) for more details.

### ::profile
The `profile` class method is used to specify a mediatype profile that the serializer is conforming to. This is optional and does not change anything about how things get serialized.
This method exist only to specify that a given serializer will produce content with semantic meaning described in the specified mediatype profile.  
The profile is retrieved with the class method `semantic_profile`.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  profile "foobar"
end

PostSerializer.semantic_profile     # => "foobar"

# Or with a block

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  profile do
    "foo#{options[:foo]}"
  end
end

PostSerializer.semantic_profile(foo: 'bar')     # => "foobar"
```

### ::policy
The `policy` class method is used to register a policy class that should be used during serialization. The purpose of using a policy class is to specify rules about which properties should be serialized (depending on the context). E.g hide some attributes and/or links if `current_user` is not an admin. If a policy is specified, then by default no properties will be serialized unless the policy explicitly allows them to be serialized.  
Using polices is not required, but its a nice way to structure rules about what should be shown and what actions (links) are possible to perform on a resource. The latter is usually tightly coupled with authorization in controllers. This means we can create polices with a bunch of rules and use the same policy in both serialization and in controllers. This plays nicely with gems like [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit).
Instances of the class registered with this method needs to respond to the following methods:
- `initialize(current_user, resource, options = {})`
- `attribute?(name)`
- `link?(rel)`
- `embed?(name)`

Additional methods will be needed for authorization in controller. Such as `create?`, `update?` etc when using Pundit.
A policy instance will be instantiated with the resource being serialized and the option `:current_user` passed to `::to_hal`. For each attribute being serialized a call to `policy_instance.attribute?(name)` will be made. If that call returns `true` then the attribute will be serialized. Else it will not end up in the serialized payload. Same goes for links and embedded resources. Curies are ignored by policies and always serialized.
Using the following Policy would discard everything except the _title_ attribute, the _self_ link and only embedded resources if `current_user` is an admin user.
``` ruby
class SomePolicy
  attr_reader :current_user, :resource, :options

  def initialize(current_user, resource, options = {})
    @current_user = current_user
    @resource = resource
    @options = options
  end

  def attribute?(name)
    name.to_s == 'title'
  end

  def link?(rel)
    rel == :self
  end

  def embed?(_name)
    return false unless current_user
    current_user.admin?
  end
end

```
This gem includes a DSL that simplifies creating policies. See [`HALPresenter::Policy::DSL`](#policy-dsl).

### ::namespace
Multiple links and embedded resources may be grouped together inside a curie namespace. This is done by wrapping them inside a block passed to `::namespace`.
``` ruby
class DogSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :name
  link :self do
    "/dogs/#{resource.name}"
  end
end

class PetSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  namespace :foo do
    link :owner do
      "/users/#{resource.owner_id}"
    end
    embed :animal, presenter_class: DogSerializer
  end
  curie :foo do
    '/some_link/{rel}'
  end
end

dog = OpenStruct.new(id: 3, name: 'Milo')
pet = OpenStruct.new(owner_id: 5, animal: dog)

PetSerializer.to_hal(pet)   # => {"_links":{"foo:owner":{"href":"/users/5"},"curies":[{"name":"foo","href":"/some_link/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"foo:animal":{"name":"Milo","_links":{"self":{"href":"/dogs/Milo"}}}}}
```

### ::embed
The `embed` class method specifies a nested resource to be embedded. The first argument, `name`, is required. When `::embed` is called with only one argument, the resource being serialized is expected to respond to the value of that argument and the returned value is what ends up in the payload. The keyword argument `presenter_class` specifies the serializer to be used for serializing the embedded resource.
``` ruby
class UserSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :name
end

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  embed :author, presenter_class: UserSerializer
end

user = OpenStruct.new(name: "bengt")
post = OpenStruct.new(title: "hello", author: user)
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"_embedded":{"author":{"name":"bengt"}}}
```
If `::embed` is called with two arguments, then the second arguments is embedded.
``` ruby
class UserSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :name
end

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  embed :author, OpenStruct.new(name: "bengt"), presenter_class: UserSerializer
end

post = OpenStruct.new(title: "hello")
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"_embedded":{"author":{"name":"bengt"}}}
```
When a block is passed to `::embed`, then the return value of that block is embedded.
``` ruby
class UserSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :name
end

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  embed :author, presenter_class: UserSerializer do
    OpenStruct.new(name: "bengt")
  end
end

post = OpenStruct.new(title: "hello")
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"_embedded":{"author":{"name":"bengt"}}}
```
The keyword argument `:embed_depth` may be specified to set a max allowed nesting depth for the corresponding resource to be embedded. See [`embed_depth`](#keyword-argument-embed_depth-passed-to-attribute-link-curie-and-embed).  
 If the resource to be embedded has a registered Serializer then `presenter_class` is not needed.
``` ruby
class User
  def name; "bengt"; end
end

class UserSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model User
  attribute :name
end

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  embed :author
end

post = OpenStruct.new(title: "hello", author: User.new)
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"_embedded":{"author":{"name":"bengt"}}}
```
If the embedded resource has a curie then it will be added to the root resource rather than the embedded resource. If there is a curie name conflict between the root resource and any embedded resources,
one or many of them will get renamed.
``` ruby
class FooSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :info
  link :foo, curie: :doc do
    '/foo'
  end
  curie :doc do
    '/doc/{rel}'
  end
end

class BarSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :info
  link :bar, curie: :doc do
    '/bar'
  end
  curie :doc do
    '/conflicting/{rel}'
  end
end

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  curie :doc do
    '/doc/{rel}'
  end
  embed :foo, presenter_class: FooSerializer
  embed :bar, presenter_class: BarSerializer
end

post = OpenStruct.new(
  foo: OpenStruct.new(info: "doc means the same thing for foo"),
  bar: OpenStruct.new(info: "doc conflicts with Foo and Post. It must be renamed!")
)
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # =>
                              # {
                              #   "_links": {
                              #     "curies": [
                              #       {
                              #         "name": "doc",
                              #         "href": "/doc/{rel}",
                              #         "templated": true
                              #       },
                              #       {
                              #         "name": "doc0",
                              #         "href": "/conflicting/{rel}",
                              #         "templated": true
                              #       }
                              #     ]
                              #   },
                              #   "_embedded": {
                              #     "foo": {
                              #       "info": "doc means the same thing for foo",
                              #       "_links": {
                              #         "doc:foo": {
                              #           "href": "/foo"
                              #         }
                              #       }
                              #     },
                              #     "bar": {
                              #       "info": "doc conflicts with Foo and Post. It must be renamed!",
                              #       "_links": {
                              #         "doc0:bar": {
                              #           "href": "/bar"
                              #         }
                              #       }
                              #     }
                              #   }
                              # }
```
Note that the curie in `FooSerializer` has the same href as the curie in `PostSerializer`, thus it remains unaffected. The curie in `BarSerializer` however has another href and needs to be renamed. The new name is `doc0`. Any rels (links and embedded) refering to the renamed curie will be updated with the new curie name (e.g. `doc0:bar`).  

### collection
The `collection` class method is used to make a serializer capable of serializing an array of resources. Serializing collections may of course be done with separate serializer, but should we want to use the same serializer class for both then `::collection` will make that work. The method takes a required keyword paramter named `:of`, which will be used as the key in the corresponding _\_embedded_ property. Each entry in the array given to `::to_collection` will then be serialized with this serializer.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :id
  attribute :title
  collection of: 'posts'
end

list = (1..2).map do |i|
  OpenStruct.new(id: i, title: "hello#{i}")
end

PostSerializer.to_collection(list)   # => {"_embedded":{"posts":[{"id":1,"title":"hello1"},{"id":2,"title":"hello2"}]}}
```
The `collection` class method takes an optional block. The purpose of this block is to be able to set attributes, links and embedded resources on the serialized collection.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :id
  attribute :title
  collection of: 'posts' do
    attribute(:number_of_posts) { resources.count }
    link :self do
      format "/posts%s", (options[:page] && "?page=#{options[:page]}")
    end
    link :next do
      "/posts?page=#{options[:next]}" if options[:next]
    end
  end
end

list = (1..2).map do |i|
  OpenStruct.new(id: i, title: "hello#{i}")
end

PostSerializer.to_collection(list, page: 1, next: 2)   # => {"number_of_posts":2,"_links":{"self":{"href":"/posts?page=1"},"next":{"href":"/posts?page=2"}},"_embedded":{"posts":[{"id":1,"title":"hello1"},{"id":2,"title":"hello2"}]}}"
```
The response above with some newlines.
```sh
{
  "number_of_posts": 2,
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/posts?page=1"
    },
    "next": {
      "href": "/posts?page=2"
    }
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "hello1"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "hello2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Note: the block given to the `:number_of_posts` attribute is using the method `resources`. This is just and alias for `resource` which looks better inside collections. 

#### Keyword argument `:embed_depth` passed to `::attribute`, `::link`, `::curie` and `::embed`
The `:embed_depth` keyword arguments specifies for which levels of embedding the correponding property should be serialized.
 - `nil`: The property it is always serialized.
 - `0`: The property is only serialized when the resource is not embedded.
 - `1`: The property is serialized when it's embedded at most 1 level deep.
 - etc..

Consider the following payload representing a post resource:
```sh
{
  "id": 1,
  "message": "lorem ipsum..",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/posts/1"
    },
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "comments": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "comment": "hello1"
        "_embedded": {
          "user": {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "foo",
            "_links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "/users/2"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "comment": "hello2"
        "_embedded": {
          "user": {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "foo",
            "_links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "/users/3"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Here the post attributes `id`, `message` as well as the _self_ link and the embedded comments all have a depth of 0. The properties of each embedded comment (attributes `id`, `comment` and embedded user) have a depth of 1. The properties of the user resources (embedded in the comments, which in turn are embedded in the post resource) have a depth of 2.  
When a collection is serialized (using `::to_collection`) the embedded resources will have the same depth as attributes and links on collection (e.g. depth = 0 unless the collection itself is embedded).  
The purpose of specifying `embed_depth` is to be able skip serializing properties when embeddeed.  
For example, when you serialize a collection of resources, perhaps you would like for each resource in that collection to only serialize a few properties, making it kind of like a "preview" of each resource.

#### blocks passed to `::attribute`, `::link`, `::curie`, `::embed` and `::collection`
Blocks passes to `::attribute`, `::link`, `::curie` and `::embed` have access to the resource being serialized throught the `resource` method. These blocks also have access to an optional `options` hash that can be passed to `::to_hal`.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :title do
    "#{resource.id} -- #{resource.title} -- #{options[:extra]}"
  end
end

post = OpenStruct.new(id: 5, title: "hello")
PostSerializer.to_hal(post, extra: 'world')   # => {"title": "5 -- hello -- world"}
```
These blocks also have access to the scope where the block was created (e.g. the Serializer class)
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  def self.prefix; "-->"; end
  attribute :title do
    "#{prefix} #{resource.title}"
  end
end

post = OpenStruct.new(id: 5, title: "hello")
PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"title": "--> hello"}
```
Note: this does not mean that `self` inside the block is the serializer class. The access to the serializer class methods is done by delegation.  
If the block passed to `::attribute` evaluates to `nil` then the serialized value will be `null`. If the block passed to `::link`, `::curie` or `::embed` evaluates to `nil`,
then the corresponding property will not be serialized.
``` ruby
class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  attribute :title
  attribute :foo { nil }
  link :self { "/posts/#{resource.id}" }
  link :edit do
    "/posts/#{resource.id}" if resource.author_id == options[:current_user].id
  end
end

user = OpenStruct.new(id: 5)
post = OpenStruct.new(id: 1, title: "hello", author_id: 2)
PostSerializer.to_hal(post, current_user: user)   # => {"title":"hello","foo":null,"_links":{"self":{"href":"/posts/1"}}}

user = OpenStruct.new(id: 2)
PostSerializer.to_hal(post, current_user: user)   # => "{"title":"hello","foo":null,"_links":{"self":{"href":"/posts/1"},"edit":{"href":"/posts/1"}}}"
```


### ::to_hal
See examples in [`::attribute`](#attribute), [`::link`](#link), [`::curie`](#curie) and [`::embed`](#embed).

### ::to_collection
See examples in [`::collection`](#collection)

### ::post_serialize
The `::post_serialize` class method can used to run a hook after each serialization. This method must be called with a block taking one parameter (which will be a Hash of the serialized result). This can be convenient when dynamic properties needs to be added to the serialized payload. As an example say that you have a Form class and a FormSerializer that should be used to serialize different kinds of forms.
```ruby
  class Field
    attr_reader :name, :type, :value

    def initialize(name, params = {})
      @name = name
      @type = params[:type]
      @has_value = params.key? :value
      @value = params[:value]
    end

    def has_value?
      @has_value
    end
  end

  class Form
    attr_accessor :resource, :name, :title, :href, :method, :type, :self_link, :fields

    def initialize(params = {})
      @name = params[:name]
      @title = params[:title]
      @method = params[:method] || :post
      @type = params[:type] || 'application/json'
      @fields = (params[:fields] || {}).map { |name, args| Field.new(name, args) }
    end
  end
  
  class FormSerializer
    extend HALPresenter

    model Form
    profile 'shaf-form'

    attribute :method do
      (resource&.method || 'POST').to_s.upcase
    end

    attribute :name do
      resource&.name
    end

    attribute :title do
      resource&.title
    end

    attribute :href do
      resource&.href
    end

    attribute :type do
      resource&.type
    end

    link :self do
      resource&.self_link
    end

    link :profile,
      "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sammyhenningsson/39c8aafeaf60192b082762cbf3e08d57/raw/shaf-form.md"

    post_serialize do |hash|
      fields = resource&.fields
      break if fields.nil? || fields.empty?
      hash[:fields] = fields.map do |field|
        { name: field.name, type: field.type }.tap do |f|
          f[:value] = field.value if field.has_value?
        end
      end
    end
  end
```
Now this setup can be used to serialize different kinds of forms with a single serializer.
```ruby
common_fields = {
  email: { type: "string"},
  password: { type: "string"}
}

create_form = Form.new(name: 'create-user', title: 'Create User', fields: common_fields.merge({username: { type: "string"}}))
create_form.href = '/users'

edit_form = Form.new(name: 'edit-user', title: 'Update User', method: :put, fields: common_fields)
edit_form.href = '/users/5/edit'

FormSerializer.to_hal(create_form)
FormSerializer.to_hal(edit_form)
```
This would give the following:
```ruby
{
    "href": "/users",
    "method": "POST",
    "name": "create-user",
    "title": "Create User",
    "type": "application/json",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "email",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "password",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "username",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}

{
    "href": "/users/5/edit",
    "method": "PUT",
    "name": "edit-user",
    "title": "Update User",
    "type": "application/json",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "email",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "password",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}

```

### from_hal
The class method `from_hal` is used to deserialize a payload into a model instance. If there are links in the payload they will be discarded. Fields in the payload that
does not have a corresponding attribute or embed in the serializer will be ignored.

```ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :name
end

class Post
  attr_accessor :title, :author
end

class UserSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model User
  attribute :name
  link :self, '/user'
end

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model Post
  attribute :title
  link :self, '/post'
  embed :author, presenter_class: UserSerializer
end

user = User.new
user.name = "bengt"

post = Post.new
post.title= "hello"
post.author = user

payload = PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"title":"hello","_links":{"self":{"href":"/post"}},"_embedded":{"author":{"name":"bengt","_links":{"self":{"href":"/user"}}}}}"

post = PostSerializer.from_hal(payload)
post.title                               # => "hello"
post.author.name                         # => "bengt"

```
Instances are created by calling `::new` on the class registered by `::model` without any arguments. Then each attribute is set with *`#attribute_name=`* (e.g.
`post.title = 'hello'`)
Thus, all models used for deserialization must respond to *`attribute_name=`* for all attributes used in the serializer.  
If the model can't be created without arguments (or if the instance already exit), then the instance can be passed to `::from_hal`.
```ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Post
  attr_accessor :title, :author

  def initialize(title, author)
    @title = title
    @author = author
  end
end

class UserSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model User
  attribute :name
  link :self, '/user'
end

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model Post
  attribute :title
  link :self, '/post'
  embed :author, presenter_class: UserSerializer
end

payload = JSON.generate(
  {
    "title": "hello",
    "_embedded": {
      "author": {
        "name": "bengt"
      }
    }
  }
)

user = User.new('will_be_overwritten')
post = Post.new('will_be_overwritten', user)

post = PostSerializer.from_hal(payload, post)
post.title                               # => "hello"
post.author.name                         # => "bengt"
```
Collections can be deserialized into an array as long as the serializer has a collection. In this case the model instance cannot be passed as an argument
so it must be possbile to create new instances with _ModelName_.new (whithout any arguments).
```ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :name
end

class UserSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  model User
  attribute :name
  link :self, '/user'
  collection of: 'users'
end

users =  (1..5).map do |i|
  {
    name: "user#{i}",
    foo: "ignored"
  }
end

payload = JSON.generate(
  {
    _embedded: {
      users: users
    }
  }
)

users = UserSerializer.from_hal(payload)
users.class                              # => Array
users.first.class                        # => User
users.map(&:name)                        # => ["user1", "user2", "user3", "user4", "user5"]                         
```

## Inheritance
Serializers may use inheritance and should work just as expected 
```ruby
class BaseSerializer
  extend HALPresenter

  attribute :base, "will_be_overwritten"
  attribute :title

  link :self do
    resource_path(resource.id)
  end
end

class PostSerializer < BaseSerializer
  attribute :base, "child_attribute"
  
  def self.resource_path(id)
    "/posts/#{id}"
  end
end

post = OpenStruct.new(id: 5, title: 'hello')

PostSerializer.to_hal(post)   # => {"title": "hello", "base": "child_attribute", "_links": {"self": {"href": "/posts/5"}}}
```

## Config
### HALPresenter.base_href
This module method can be used to specify a base url that will get prepended to links hrefs.
```ruby
HALPresenter.base_href = 'https://localhost:3000/'

class PostSerializer
  extend HALPresenter
  link :self, '/posts/1'
end

PostSerializer.to_hal   # => {"_links": {"self": {"href": "https://localhost:3000/posts/1"}}}
```

### HALPresenter.paginate
Setting `HALPresenter.paginate = true` will add next/prev links for collections when possible. Requirements for this is:
- The resource being serialized is a paginated collection (Kaminari, will_paginate and Sequel are supported)
- The serializer being used has a collection block which declares a self link

## Policy DSL
HALPresenter includes a DSL for creating polices. By including `HALPresenter::Policy::DSL` into your policy class you get the following class methods:
- `::attribute(*names, &block)`
- `::link(*rels, &block)`
- `::embed(*names, &block)`

These methods all work the same way and creates one or more rules for each `name` argument (`rel` for links). If no block is given then the corresponding attribute/link/embedded resource will always be serialized. If the block evaluates to `true` then the attribute/link/embedded resource will be serialized. Otherwise it will not be serialized. The block has access to the current user, the resource that is being serialized, as well as any options passed to `::to_hal` from the methods `current_user`, `resource` resp. `options`.
```ruby
class UserPolicy
  include HALPresenter::Policy::DSL

  attribute :first_name, :last_name

  attribute :email do
    # show name and email attributes if user is logged in
    !current_user.nil?
  end
  
  attribute :ssn do
    # Only show ssn if the resource belongs to current_user
    current_user && resource.user.id == current_user.id
  end
  
  link :self
  
  link :edit do
    edit?
  end
  
  embed :posts do
    current_user && !current_user.posts.empty?
  end
  
  def edit?
    current_user && resource.user.id == current_user.id
  end
```
Notice the instance method `#edit?` which is typically used by [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit). That method is called from the block belonging to the rule for the edit link. This means that we can use the same policy class both for serialization and for authorization (and have all the rules in one place). This is great since we should only provide links to actions that are possible (authorized) and we don't want to sync this between controller code and serialization code.

Policies can be inherited, so probably it makes sense to have a base policy that other policies can inherit from. Like:
```ruby
class BasePolicy
  include HALPresenter::Policy::DSL

  def authenticated?
    !!current_user
  end
end

class CommentPolicy < BasePolicy
  link :post

  link :comment do
    authenticated?
  end
end
```

Sometimes policies may depend on other policies. For thoses cases we can delegate to another policy. Like:
```ruby
class CommentPolicy < BasePolicy
  def read?
    delegate_to PostPolicy, :read?, resource: resource.post
  end
end
```
Besides `#delegate_to(policy_class, method, resource: nil, args: nil, **opts)`, there is also:
 - `#delegate_attribute(policy_class, attr, **opts)`
 - `#delegate_link(policy_class, rel, **opts)`
 - `#delegate_embed(policy_class, rel, **opts)`
